# Website that shows the train and rail stations, and rail lines in New Zealand


The following project shows an html webpage with a map from OpenStreetMap of the train and rail stations, and rail lines in New Zealand. The map is centered around the South Island, as that is our area of interest. The map style was created on Mapbox using a custom theme that was created. Using GeoJSON points of train stations and lines of railways were added using QGIS and then imported using Leaflet. A popup window was added to the points and lines, then the points and lines were custom styled by changing the attributes.
